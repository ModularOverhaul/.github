ModularOverhaul is a Resource Pack selector like [VT](https://vanillatweaks.net/) and [OR Tweaks](https://twitter.com/ortweaks) with a unique focus on overhauling certain texture groups.

It works on Tags instead of categories, with a filter for tags and author for example. You could like a certain authorâ€™s style, therefore sort for author and then mix & match your desired packs. Kind of like normal resource packs, but destructured and modular so you can easily mix and match two, three or however many packs you want.
